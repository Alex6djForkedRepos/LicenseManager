## Description

This project ensures that software licenses are securely generated and validated,
providing a robust mechanism for software protection.

**License Manager X** is a graphical front-end application designed to create and manage
licenses for software applications using .NET.
It leverages the [Standard.Licensing](https://github.com/junian/Standard.Licensing)
project to handle license generation and validation.

In addition to this Windows application, License Manager X can also be used
from a command line to support scripting, etc.

The optional [LicenseManager_12noon.Client NuGet package](https://nuget.org/packages/LicenseManager_12noon.Client)
has an improved API to validate licenses for your .NET application.

Your application will need to import the [LicenseManager_12noon.Client](https://nuget.org/packages/LicenseManager_12noon.Client)
NuGet package, which has an improved API to validate licenses for your .NET application.
Alternatively, your application can use the original **Standard.Licensing** NuGet package on which it is based.
You can switch at any time--you are not locked in to one or the other.

> Note that the **LicenseManager_12noon.Client** NuGet package includes the fixes in the
[Standard.Licensing.12noon NuGet package](https://nuget.org/packages/Standard.Licensing.12noon)
for the `Expiration` property.
When the pull request with those fixes is accepted into the original **Standard.Licensing** project,
the **Standard.Licensing.12noon** package will be deprecated.

You can download the License Manager X application from the Microsoft Store.

## Features

### Key Management

| Property | Usage |
|----------|-------|
| Passphrase | Secret used to generate public/private keypair and to create a license |
| Public key | Used by the licensed application to validate the license |
| ID | License ID (You can use it any way you want or not at all) |
| Product ID | Used by the licensed application to verify the executable and public key. |
| Lock to assembly | This ensures the license is associated _ONLY_ with _THIS_ build of the licensed application. |

The application maintains the private key in the `.private` file but does not display it.

### Product

| Property | Usage |
|----------|-------|
| Name | The product name |
| Version | The product version |
| Date published | The date the product was published |

These values can be displayed by the licensed application.

The publish date can represent any date you want.

### Product Features

You can add custom product features to your license by specifying them in the `key=value` format.
These features allow you to define additional metadata or functionality for your product.

1. In the **Product features** field, enter your custom feature in the `key=value` format.
2. Add as many features as needed, each on a new line.
3. Save the license file to apply the changes.

For example:

| Key=Value       |
|-----------------|
| Feature1=Enabled |
| Feature2=False |
| MaxWidgets=100 |

The licensed application can then read and use these features as needed.

### License

| Property | Usage |
|----------|-------|
| Type | Standard or trial license |
| Expiration Date | The date on which the license expires. `DateTime.MaxDate.Date` means no expiry. |
| Expiration | The number of days until the license expires. Zero means no expiry. |
| Quantity | Minimum value is one (1) |

The licensed application can check the type to permit only certain features.

If the expiration is set to zero, there is no expiry.

The quantity is not enforced.

### License Attributes

License attributes can also be added using the `key=value` format.
These attributes allow you to define additional properties for the license.

1. In the **License attributes** field, enter your custom attribute in the `key=value` format.
2. Add as many attributes as needed, each on a new line.
3. Save the license file to apply the changes.

For example:
   
| Key=Value       |
|-----------------|
| Region=US |
| SupportLevel=Premium |

The licensed application can access these attributes to enforce specific behaviors or display relevant information.

### Licensee

This information can be displayed by the licensed application.

| Property | Usage |
|----------|-------|
| Name | Name of the licensee |
| Email | Email of the licensee |
| Company | Company of the licensee (optional) |

## Usage

### Create a New License

Note that the public key and product ID are passed by the licensed application
to validate the license, so you only want to create a new keypair or change the
product ID if you want to change them in the licensed application, rebuild it,
and create new licenses for anyone who will use the new build.

1. Create a keypair by entering a value for _Passphrase_ and pressing _Create Keypair_ button.
1. Enter a _Product ID_.
1. Optionally, lock the license to a specific build of the licensed application.
1. Fill in the product information, license information, and licensee information.
1. Press the _Save Keypair..._ button. This will prompt you for where to save the `.private` file.
1. Press the _Save License..._ button. This will prompt you for where to save the `.lic` file.

The `.private` file contains all of the information used to create the license, including the secrets.
Do keep the `.private` file somewhere safe.
Do NOT add the `.private` file to source control.
You will need it to create more licenses for your licensed application
(unless you want to update the application to use a new public key).

### Create a License Based on an Existing License

1. Press the *Load Keypair or License or Both...* button to select a `.private` or
`.lic` file (or both of them). Alternatively, you can drag/drop a `.private` and/or `.lic` file.
1. After loading both files, License Manager X will validate the license file.

If the license is invalid (_e.g._, it expired or the assembly has changed), you can create a new (valid) license.

1. Now you can update the product, license, or licensee information as needed.
1. Press the _Save Keypair..._ button to save the keypair file. This will
prompt you for where to save the `.private` file.
1. Press the _Save License..._ button to create a new license. This will
prompt you for where to save the `.lic` file.

### Command Line Interface

The License Manager X application includes a built-in command line interface. The same executable
can run in both GUI mode (when launched without arguments) and CLI mode (when arguments are provided).

Once you have created a `.private` file using the GUI, you can use the
command line interface to generate new license files more efficiently.

#### Usage

`lmx` is the Windows app execution alias for License Manager X. You can manage this in Windows Settings.

```cmd
lmx --private <path> (--save | --license <path> | --save --license <path>) [options]
```

#### Required Arguments

- `--private, -p <path>` - Path to the `.private` file

#### One or More Arguments is Required

You must specify at least one of these switches. They may be used together.

- `--license, -l <path>` - Path to the new `.lic` file (must not exist)
- `--save, -s` - Save the modified properties to the `.private` file

#### Optional Arguments

- `--product-version, -v <version>` - Product version
- `--product-publish-date, -pd <date>` - Product publish date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `--product-features, -pf <pairs>` - Product features as key=value pairs
- `--type, -t <type>` - License type: Standard or Trial
- `--quantity, -q <number>` - License quantity (positive integer)
- `--expiration-days, -dy <days>` - Expiration in days (0 = no expiry)
- `--expiration-date, -dt <date>` - Expiration date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `--license-attributes, -la <pairs>` - License attributes as key=value pairs
- `--lock <path>` - Lock license to a specific DLL or EXE file
- `--help, -h` - Show help

#### Examples

```cmd
REM Create a standard license using default settings from .private file
lmx -p my.private -l customer.lic

REM Create a 30-day trial license
lmx -p my.private -l trial.lic --type Trial --expiration-days 30

REM Create an enterprise license with custom quantity and version
lmx -p my.private -l enterprise.lic --quantity 100 --product-version 2.1.0

REM Create a license locked to a specific executable
lmx -p my.private -l locked.lic --lock C:\MyApp\MyApp.exe

REM Create a license with custom product features
lmx -p my.private -l featured.lic --product-features "Color=Blue Bird=Heron MaxUsers=50"

REM Create a license with custom attributes
lmx -p my.private -l attributed.lic --license-attributes "Department=Engineering Location=Seattle"

REM Combine multiple options
lmx -p my.private -l full.lic --type Trial --expiration-days 30 --lock C:\MyApp\MyApp.exe --product-features "Edition=Pro" --license-attributes "CustomerTier=Gold"
```

#### Key=Value Format

For `--product-features` and `--license-attributes`, use space-separated key=value pairs:
- Format: `"key1=value1 key2=value2 key3=value3"`
- Keys cannot be empty
- Values can be empty: `"Key="` or `Key`
- Spaces in values are not supported (use quotes around individual pairs if needed)

#### Security Notes

The CLI **cannot** override these protected properties from the `.private` file:
- Passphrase
- Public or private keys  
- Product name
- Customer name, email, or company

**Reserved Names:**
- Product features cannot use: `Product`, `Version`, `Publish Date`
- License attributes cannot use: `Product Identity`, `Assembly Identity`, `Expiration Days`

If the license file already exists, it will not be overwritten and an error will be displayed.

### The Licensed Application

Install the `LicenseManager_12noon.Client` NuGet package in your application.

The licensed application must pass the **Product ID** and the **Public Key** to the license validation API.

```
const string PRODUCT_ID = "My Product ID";	// Copied from the License Manager X application
const string PUBLIC_KEY = "The Public Key";	// Copied from the License Manager X application
LicenseFile license = new();
bool isValid = license.IsLicenseValid(PRODUCT_ID, PUBLIC_KEY, out string messages);
if (!isValid)
{
	// INVALID
	MessageBox.Show("The license is invalid. " + messages);
	return;
}

// VALID
if (license.StandardOrTrial == LicenseType.Trial)
{
	// Example: LIMIT FEATURES FOR TRIAL
}
```

If the license is valid, you can use any of the properties (_e.g._, for display or to limit features).

Alternatively, you can use the `Standard.Licensing` NuGet package to validate the license in your application.

**Note:** Of course, the hash of _Product ID_ and _Public Key_ will not prevent a determined
hacker from working around the license. However, it will prevent a simple text substitution
of the public key.

You could also do something more involved, such as prompting the licensee the first
time they run the application to enter some secret text (_e.g._, a password or GUID)
and storing a hash of it and the public key in protected storage.
Then the application could use the hash as the _Product ID_.
Of course, the licensee would have to keep that text as secret as they
should keep the license file.

### Example Application

The **LicenseManagerX_Example** project is an example application to demonstrate how to
use the NuGet client library to validate a license and access the license's information.
